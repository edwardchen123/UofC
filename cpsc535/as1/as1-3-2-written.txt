CPSC 535 Assignment 1, Question 3 - Haar Wavelets
Written Component

Question One - The High Frequency Data

The more decompositions have been performed on the image the more detail the high frequency
data begins to show in image form. By the final decomposition the cat is clearly visible,
although the dark parts in the high frequency image are light areas in the original.
Interestingly, details not visible in the original image are visible in the high frequency
image - the cat's eyes are easily seen. The range of the high frequency data is as follows:

First decomposition - [-9.25, 8.75]
Second decomposition - [-13.688, 13.438]
Third decomposition - [-26.312, 22.906]

As the range grows, features become more visible to the eye in the high frequency data. 

Question Two - Image Compression

For lossy image compression, performing Haar decomposition then throwing away the high
frequency data appears to be a simple solution to halve the image's size while preserving
main features. Alternatively, compression algorithms could be applied individually
to the high and low frequency data, optimized for their differing characteristics. This
could achieve better compression than using a single algorithm on the image as a whole,
and once the high and low frequency data are decompressed they can be combined to recreate
the original image.

Question Three - Limits of Haar Decomposition

There could eventually be an iteration of Haar decomposition after which the image is
unusable for its intended purpose, by virtue of having too little data; the low frequency
data has been reduced to the point where major features are thrown away as noise. However,
it may be useful to continue decomposing to this point if interest is focused mostly on
the noise itself, as more decompositions lead to more sensitive high frequency data.
