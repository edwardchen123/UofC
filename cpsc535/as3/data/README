bwlabel.cc is a component labelling algorithm implemented in C (for speed) for
execution from Octave.

To use it you will need a .oct file compatible with the version of octave and
machine that you are using.  To make the .oct file use the following command on
the system that you run octave from

    mkoctfile bwlabel.cc

You should get a .o and a .oct file.

If you have trouble (I did on the spark machines) try csl which runs Linux.
