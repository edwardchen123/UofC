Instructions:

Compile by typing 'scons' on the command line in the same directory as the SConstruct
file. This will compile the program, and the program 'main' will be found in the 
'build/app' directory. scons is better than make because scons is written in python.

To run the program, use ./main <filename.bmp>.

To (ostensibly) apply filters, right click and select the filter to apply. You will
be prompted on the command line for relevant input.

For some reason it won't be redrawn with a modified texture though, so if you actually
want to see what the filters do you'll have to make explicit calls to the ImageManip
class from the main function, recompiling then running every time (commented-out code
is provided as an example). That will redraw the image. But not if you do it the other 
way. COMPUTER SCIENCE.

The following functions were copied from tutorial code:
- DrawScene in main.cpp
- ResizeWindow in main.cpp
- Keyboard in main.cpp

I have completed no bonuses.
